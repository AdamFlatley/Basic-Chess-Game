# Basic-Chess-Game
Project for recreating a chess game using OOP
This was made for my Third year OOP in C++ module at UoM
Lots of improvements could still be made upon revisiting this such as nicer graphic design, better user interface and implementation
of niche chess rules such as the castleing rule.
As of right now, no intentions to revisit unless to implement these at a later date.
